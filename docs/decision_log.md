### DEC-001: SQLite3 as primary database
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Rails 8 ships with solid defaults for SQLite3 including Solid Queue, Solid Cache, and Solid Cable. For MVP projects, PostgreSQL adds operational complexity without proportional benefit.
**Decision:** Use SQLite3 for all storage (application data, job queue, cache, Action Cable).
**Consequences:** Simpler deployment and development setup. No external database service needed. May need to migrate to PostgreSQL if the app requires advanced features (full-text search, JSONB operators, concurrent writes at scale).

### DEC-002: Hotwire-only frontend
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** The project needs interactive UIs but doesn't require the complexity of a full SPA framework. Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) provides server-rendered HTML with selective interactivity.
**Decision:** Use Turbo Frames, Turbo Streams, and Stimulus for all frontend interactivity. No React, Vue, or other JS frameworks.
**Consequences:** Faster initial development. Less client-side complexity. Server-side rendering by default. May need to reconsider for highly interactive features (complex drag-and-drop, real-time collaborative editing).

### DEC-003: ActionPolicy for authorization
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Need a consistent authorization layer. Options considered: Pundit, CanCanCan, ActionPolicy.
**Decision:** Use ActionPolicy. It provides a clean DSL, better Rails integration, and built-in caching.
**Consequences:** All authorization logic lives in policy classes. Controllers use `authorize!`. Policies are testable in isolation.

### DEC-004: Service objects for business logic
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Business logic needs a consistent home outside of controllers and models. Fat models and fat controllers both lead to maintenance problems.
**Decision:** All business logic goes in service objects in `app/services/`. Two patterns: `call` (returns data) and `save` (persists, returns boolean).
**Consequences:** Controllers stay thin. Models focus on persistence. Services are independently testable. New developers have a clear place to put logic.
